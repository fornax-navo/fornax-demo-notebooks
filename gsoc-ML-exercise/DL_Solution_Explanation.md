At first, I investigated the astropy.io.fits structures in depth to familiarize and I tried to search for more information about this. Then, after understanding the assignment and reviewing the provided resources, I started to explore methods to predict measurements until I decided to use interpolation as a simple way to predict the requested values.  

As my solution, I implemented an interpolation function that linearly interpolates the measurements with respect to the wavelengths of all galaxies of each field and obtains the requested measurements directly from the interpolated function. I also showed the plot of 3 sample galaxies of the original measurements and the wavelengths, as well as the predicted ones with the interpolation function obtained to see that the interpolation works well. There are more advanced interpolations that can offer better approximations like Polynomial or Spline interpolations which could be easily implemented based on this solution.   

With more time, another possible solution could be implementing an ML or DL regression model for each field that could predict, as the output, the measurements of a target wavelength, receiving as input all the wavelengths with its measurements except the target wavelength measurement, and the target wavelength as a separated feature. The target wavelength could be highlighted in the model using weighted variables. The dataset used for training would be for each target wavelength all the galaxies' wavelengths and measurements with the target output as the measurements of the target wavelength. The model could be a Deep Neural Network for predicting the requested measurements for the wavelengths provided separately after training with the dataset. In the first place, I tried to implement the model and build the dataset but the computational cost made the executing time too long for this project scope.
