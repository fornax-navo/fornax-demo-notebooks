# Data - Forced Photometry

This directory is used for data that is downloaded or otherwise retrieved for use by the forced photometry notebook and related scripts. Users may also store additional data here. Note that there is a separate directory for output generated by the notebook or its users.

New data should not be committed to the code repository. This directory is included in the .gitignore file to prevent accidental commits.
